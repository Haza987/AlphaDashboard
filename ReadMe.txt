I have used GitHub copilot throughout my project. I have marked lines of code that have been helped by copilot with a comment.

GitHub Copilot helped me with most of the Javascript code, however I did the majority of the validation scripts myself.

I would have added image functionality for users and members but I ran out of time so focused on the requirements of the project.
